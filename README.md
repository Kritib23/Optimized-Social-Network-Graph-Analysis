# Dynamic Social Network Analysis System

## Overview
This project involves the development of a system for analyzing and updating a dynamic social network graph. The system uses inter-process communication via shared memory, a producer-consumer model, and Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient shortest path calculations.

## Features
- **Shared Memory for IPC**: Enables efficient inter-process communication for graph updates and analysis.
- **Producer-Consumer Model**: 1 producer and 10 consumers are used to streamline shortest path calculations.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Applied for accurate and efficient shortest path computation between graph nodes.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Minimize redundant path calculations, enhancing system efficiency.

## Technical Details
- **Shared Memory**: Used for fast and efficient communication between multiple processes.
